    Font Selection is Important
    <p>
        Choosing the right font has a huge impact on how the readers experience a website.
        <br>
        The right font can create a strong identity for your brand.
    <p>
        Using a font that is easy to read is important. The font adds value to your text.
        <br>
        It is also important to choose the correct color and text size for the font.

        Generic Font Families
    <p>
        In CSS there are five generic font families:
    <p>
        Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter.
        <br>
        They create a sense of formality and elegance.
    <p>
        Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached).
        <br>
        They create a modern and minimalistic look.
    <p>
        Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look.
    <p>
        Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
    <p>
        Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
    <p>
        All the different font names belong to one of the generic font families.
    <p>
        Font Size
    <p>
        The font-size property sets the size of the text.
    <p>
        Being able to manage the text size is important in web design.
        <br>
        However, you should not use font size adjustments to make paragraphs look like headings, or
        <br>
        headings look like paragraphs.
    <p>
        Always use the proper HTML tags, like &lth1&gt - &lth6&gt for headings and &ltp&gt for paragraphs.
    <p>
        The font-size value can be an absolute, or relative size.
    <p>
        Absolute size:
    <p>
        Sets the text to a specified size
    <p>
        Does not allow a user to change the text size in all browsers (bad for accessibility reasons)
    <p>
        Absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known
    <p>
        Relative size:
    <p>
        Sets the size relative to surrounding elements
        <br>
        Allows a user to change the text size in browsers
