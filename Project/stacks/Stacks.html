        This is the Page on Stacks, Stack.hpp above is the header file as given by my professor. <br>
        stackv.cpp is the vector version of the stack and stackl.cpp is the linked list version.<br>
        A stack, in the realm of abstract data types (ADTs), is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. <br>
        It operates much like a stack of plates: the last plate placed onto the stack is the first to be removed. This ADT supports two primary operations: <br>
        push, which adds an element onto the top of the stack, and pop, which removes the top element from the stack. <br>
        Additionally, a stack typically includes a method to check the top element without removing it. <br>
        The simplicity and efficiency of stack operations make it invaluable in various computing tasks, <br>
        including expression evaluation, function call management, undo mechanisms, and backtracking algorithms.<br>
        Whether implemented using arrays, linked lists, or other data structures,<br>
        the stack ADT provides a versatile tool for managing data in a wide range of applications.
